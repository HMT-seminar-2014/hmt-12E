## Scholion 12.E9 on line 12.125 ##

!{another awesome
scholion!}[2]

A grammatical explanation.

## Scholion on line 12.125 in Townley manuscript##

ad 12. 125 {κεκληγότες} ἀπὸ τοῦ κεκλήγω Συρακουσίου ἐνεστῶτος ἀκόλουθος μετοχὴ κεκλήγων βαρυνομένη. T

Translation: {κεκληγότες} from the Syracusan present κεκλήγω, is accompanied by the recessive participle κεκλήγων.

## Notes from Aelius Herodianus ##

τὸ δὲ κεκλήγω, ᾦ ἀκόλουθος μετοχὴ ἡ κεκλήγων βαρυνομένη, ἔνθεν τὸ κεκλήγοντες (M 125) καὶ πεπλήγω, ἔνθεν τὸ "ἐπέπληγον πόδες ἵππων" (Il. E 504) ποιητικῶς βαρύνονται ἀπὸ τῶν παρακειμένων γεγονότα. 
(*Grammatici Graeci* vol. 3.1 (ed. Lentz), 434, 6-10, from Herodian's *Peri Katholikhês Prosôdias*)


Translation: But the word κεκλήγω, which is followed by the recessive participle κεκλήγων, hence κεκλήγοντες  (at *Il.* 12.125) and πεπλήγω, hence the [quotation] ἐπέπληγον πόδες ἵππων, are recessive in poetry, deriving from the perfect.

## An interesting symbol ##


!{look closely...}[rocketcontext]

!{a better view}[rocket]

This symbol may be linked to {this intermarginal scholion}[rocketscholion?].

---

## Another interesting symbol ##


!{looks like angled music notes}[anothersymbol]

We do have a {main scholion}[scholionforothersymbol?]
for this line, but there appears to be no connection to the symbol...
Thoughts?
