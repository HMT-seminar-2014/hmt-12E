## An interesting symbol ##


!{look closely...}[rocketcontext]

!{a better view}[rocket]

This symbol may be linked to {this intermarginal scholion}[rocketscholion?].

## Another interesting symbol ##


!{looks like angled music notes}[anothersymbol]

We do have a {main scholion}[scholionforothersymbol?]
for this line, but there appears to be no connection to the symbol...
Thoughts?
