### Scholion 12.E9 on 12.125 ###

!{an awesome
scholion!}[1]

A grammatical explanation: {ὀξέα κεκλήγοντες, shouting loudly} in order to help; it is not that the form κεκληγότες has added a nu (ν) and comes from “ὀξεα κεκληγώς (having shouted shrilly, i.e. the perfect participle),” but alongside the [form] κέκληγα there exists the present κεκλήγω, just as alongside the [form] ἄνωγα [there occurs] ἀνώγω [and alongside] πέπληγα [there occurs] πεπλήγω, whence “ἐπέπληγον πόδες ἵππων (the hooves of the horses struck)” (*Il*. 5.504); and the participle κεκλήγω comes from the [form] κεκλήγων (i.e. the present participle), whence comes τὸ κεκλήγοντες.

### Scholion on 12.125 in Townley manuscript###

ad 12. 125 {κεκληγότες} ἀπὸ τοῦ κεκλήγω Συρακουσίου ἐνεστῶτος ἀκόλουθος μετοχὴ κεκλήγων βαρυνομένη. T

Translation: {κεκληγότες, having shouted} from the Syracusan present κεκλήγω, is accompanied by the recessive participle κεκλήγων.

N.B. The reading κεκληγότες, found in the text and lemma of the Townley, conflicts with the content of the scholion, which supports the reading κεκλήγοντες found in the Venetus A.

### Notes from Aelius Herodianus ###

τὸ δὲ κεκλήγω, ᾦ ἀκόλουθος μετοχὴ ἡ κεκλήγων βαρυνομένη, ἔνθεν τὸ κεκλήγοντες (M 125) καὶ πεπλήγω, ἔνθεν τὸ "ἐπέπληγον πόδες ἵππων" (Il. E 504) ποιητικῶς βαρύνονται ἀπὸ τῶν παρακειμένων γεγονότα. 
(*Grammatici Graeci* vol. 3.1 (ed. Lentz), 434, 6-10, from Herodian's *Peri Katholikhês Prosôdias*)


Translation: But [the form] κεκλήγω, from which comes the recessive participle κεκλήγων, hence κεκλήγοντες  (at *Il.* 12.125), and [the form] πεπλήγω, hence the [quotation] ἐπέπληγον πόδες ἵππων, are recessive in poetry, deriving from the perfect.

πολὺ δὲ τοιοῦτον ἔθος παρὰ Συρακουσίοις· ὄλωλα ὀλώλω, δέδοικα δεδοίκω καὶ τὸ κέκλυκε δὲ παρ᾽ Ἐπιχάρμῳ ἀπὸ θέματος τοῦ κεκλύκω καὶ εὕρηκε ἀπὸ τοῦ εὑρήκω. (*Grammatici Graeci* vol. 3.2 (ed. Lentz), 830, 11-13, from Herodian's *Peri Katholikhês Prosôdias*)

Translation: This usage is common among the Syracusans: ὄλωλα [occurs alongside] ὀλώλω, δέδοικα [alongside] δεδοίκω, and the word κέκλυκε appears in Epicharmus, coming from the base form κεκλύκω, and εὕρηκε from εὑρήκω.
